My old console game, made as a course project.

Requirements: Usage of C, C++ and/or ASM languages

Accomplished by making the whole project in C++

This project helped me to accomplish those goals:

- Create a game with generating events & names
- Create a game with multiple statistics that can change in-game after every turn
- Create a loading-saving system with JSON-files
- Create a JSON serializer/deserializer
- Usage of irrKlang library for playing multiple background sounds

Those project goals were planned, but NOT accomplished:

- Create graphic application instead of a console one
- Allow multiplayer interactions

Music: Pedro Silva - Forest...
All sounds were taken from freesound.org
